      <h2> How It Works </h2>
      <hr>
      <p> It's simple, you can add me on social media, and send a DM
      or you can email me the request! </p>
      <br>

      <p> Please be sure to read the FAQs below to understand
      what I will satisfy. </p>
      <br>

      <h2> FAQs </h2>
      <hr>
      <h3> How much does custom photo cost? </h3>
      <p> A custom pictures start at $25, but can cost significantly more.</p>

      <p> For example, if you want to see my feet under running water, there are
      plenty of places I can go to accomplish this task, a bathtub, sink, or
      standard garden hose will do the trick. </p>
      <br>

      <p> But if you want to see my feet specifically under a natural waterfall,
      with a specific brand of green nail paint, I'm going to need to travel,
      and likely will need to purchase the paint. Obviously, this will cost
      (probably significantly) more than the standard $25.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3> How long Until I get my requested photo? </h3>
      <p>
      between 12 and 72 hrs - depending on the complexity of taking the
      image.
      <br> 
      <br> 

      If the request will take longer, you'll get an email back within
      the day.
      <br>
      If I need to travel, or purchase a very specific item for
      the image, we may have to wait for an item to be shipped, or a day I can
      travel to an appropriate location for the photo shoot.
      <br>
      <br>

      Please understand, I don't have every product that someone would
      want to see on or near my feet, so I may need to order various
      items to satisfy some request.
      <br>
      <br>

      That said, so long as you're willing to wait for me, I'll
      satisfy your request with few exceptions.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3> Do you need my personal information? </h3>
      <p>
	Nope. Only an email or social medai account that I can respond to.
	<br>

	You are free to create/make up whatever you'd like.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3> What are the exceptions to requests? </h3>
      <ol>
	<li> No requests to meet whatsoever will be entertained,
	  and will almost certianly result in a ban from my site. </li>

	<li> No request for my face ... dwel in the mystery. </li>

	<li> No request for body parts that are not feet,
	  covered or otherwise. If you persist, that will almost
	  certianly result in a ban from my site. </li>
	
	<li> No request for connections outise of my social
	  media and personal site will be entertaind whatsoever. </li>

	<li> You may ask any question, but I am free to refuse to
	  answer. If  I ignore your question, consider that
	  a refusal.</li>

	<li> I am free to be myself, anything I have left out
	  is at my personal disposition. </li>
      </ol>
      <br>

      <h3> Do you  require a down payment for request? </h3>
      <p>
	Currently, no. (this will depend on volume/demand in the future)
	<br>

	My tean will very likely read your email within the day you send
	it, and I will very likely respond with in that day.
	<br>

	Expect a confirmation email that I am working on your photo.
	<br>

	When the photo is prepared, I will send you a confirmation email
	containing a payment form.
	<br>

	You will pay at that time, and revice your photo at the
	"speed of email" (near instantly).
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3> Are you willing to model for my company? </h3>
      <p>
	Perhaps. You are free to send me your terms, and my
	team + leagal, I trust, will advise me appropriatly.
